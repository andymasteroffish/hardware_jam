//Please state the space that your setup will require dimension in inches (width x height x depth) of game/controller and detailed notes about how it should be set up* *
	Circumnavigators is in the form of a ~26" x 50" x 23" cylinder and should have ~36" clearance around to allow for multiple players to circumnavigate. It requires an A/C outlet for power. The cable leading to the power will be taped down to prevent players from tripping.

//Please explain in approximately one paragraph what makes this entry special and 'alt' (alternative to traditional controls). Please explain how this experience can only be captured with this unique control scheme. *
	Circumnavigators is a 360 degree LED racing game. The controller is the game itself with a unique cylindrical form factor and 360 degree LED display. Players physically move around the game pressing buttons to shift obstacles into or away from their paths, while also trying to sabotage their opponent. They compete for buttons along the way, but run the risk of losing control should their pixel escape their view. The last player alive wins!
